Project contains client using event listener pattern to stream to file orders based on a dummy market data provided by server nammed MarketDataVendor.

Sadly I did not have much time last week to finish the project properly so some features are missing like unit tests, server being multithreaded like client, more general approach to strategy criterion checking.
